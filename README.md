# 🛒 Java Shopping Cart Backend

This project is a Java-based backend system for a simple shopping cart application, developed as an assignment using principles from Building Java Programs (5th Edition). The backend connects with a provided GUI to allow users to order items, calculate total prices, and apply discounts.

💡 Features
• Item support with optional bulk pricing (e.g., 10 for $5.00)

• Total price calculation per order and across a shopping cart

• GUI integration using Swing

• 10% discount option for the entire order

• Input validation for negative prices or quantities

• Clear object-oriented design (composition over inheritance)

• Uses NumberFormat.getCurrencyInstance() for formatted prices

# 🧱 Class Breakdown
Item.java
• Stores item name and pricing (single and optional bulk).

• Methods:

  - priceFor(quantity): Calculates total price using bulk if applicable.

  - toString(): Displays pricing and bulk info.
  
  - equals(): Compares items by name and price.

Catalog.java
• A named collection of Item objects.

• Methods: add(item), get(index), size(), getName()

ItemOrder.java
• Represents an order for a single item and quantity.

• Methods:

  - getPrice(): Uses Item.priceFor()

  - getItem()

ShoppingCart.java
• Stores a list of ItemOrder objects.

• Methods:

  - add(itemOrder): Replaces order if item already exists.

  - setDiscount(boolean): Enables/disables a 10% discount.

  - getTotal(): Computes total order price with optional discount.

# 🖥️ GUI Integration
Two provided files, ShoppingFrame.java and ShoppingMain.java, create a Swing-based interface to interact with the backend:

• Add/update items in cart

• See real-time total cost updates

• Toggle discount option

# 🧪 How I Built It
• Developed and tested each class separately with print statements and test code.

• Ensured object behavior followed best practices from the textbook (e.g., .equals(), encapsulation).

• Used ArrayList for data storage without extending it, favoring composition.
