# 🛒 Java Shopping Cart Backend
This project is a Java-based backend system for a simple shopping cart application, developed as an assignment using principles from Building Java Programs (5th Edition). The backend connects with a provided GUI to allow users to order items, calculate total prices, and apply discounts.

# 💡 Features
Item support with optional bulk pricing (e.g., 10 for $5.00)

Total price calculation per order and across a shopping cart

GUI integration using Swing

10% discount option for the entire order

Input validation for negative prices or quantities

Clear object-oriented design (composition over inheritance)

Uses NumberFormat.getCurrencyInstance() for formatted prices

# 🧱 Class Breakdown
**`Item.java`**

Stores item name and pricing (single and optional bulk).

Methods:

  + priceFor(quantity): Calculates total price using bulk if applicable.

  + toString(): Displays pricing and bulk info.
  
  + equals(): Compares items by name and price.

**`Catalog.java`**

A named collection of Item objects.

Methods: add(item), get(index), size(), getName()

**`ItemOrder.java`**

Represents an order for a single item and quantity.

Methods:

  + getPrice(): Uses Item.priceFor()

  + getItem()

**`ShoppingCart.java`**

Stores a list of ItemOrder objects.

Methods:

  + add(itemOrder): Replaces order if item already exists.

  + setDiscount(boolean): Enables/disables a 10% discount.

  + getTotal(): Computes total order price with optional discount.

# 🖥️ GUI Integration
Two provided files, ShoppingFrame.java and ShoppingMain.java, create a Swing-based interface to interact with the backend:

• Add/update items in cart

• See real-time total cost updates

• Toggle discount option

# 🧪 How I Built It
- Developed and tested each class separately with print statements and test code.

- Ensured object behavior followed best practices from the textbook (e.g., .equals(), encapsulation).

- Used ArrayList for data storage without extending it, favoring composition.
